## ⚠️ Important Notes

### About Deletion:
1. **Permanent**: Deleted posts CANNOT be recovered
2. **Immediate**: Changes take effect instantly
3. **Database**: Post is removed from MongoDB
4. **Users**: Donor will no longer see it in "My Donations"
5. **Claimer**: If claimed, claimer loses access too

### Best Practices:
1. ✅ **Review before deleting** - Make sure it's actually inappropriate
2. ✅ **Use sparingly** - Only for spam/abuse/violations
3. ✅ **Document reasons** - Keep track of why posts were removed
4. ✅ **Consider alternatives** - Maybe contact user first
5. ✅ **Monitor patterns** - If same user posts spam repeatedly, consider banning

## 🎯 Use Cases

### When to Delete:
- ❌ **Spam posts**: Fake or irrelevant content
- ❌ **Inappropriate content**: Offensive or harmful
- ❌ **Scam attempts**: Fraudulent posts
- ❌ **Duplicate posts**: Same post multiple times
- ❌ **Violations**: Breaking platform rules

### When NOT to Delete:
- ✅ **Expired food**: Let it stay for records
- ✅ **Claimed food**: Shows successful sharing
- ✅ **Minor mistakes**: User can edit themselves
- ✅ **Completed posts**: Good for statistics
